The waters are divided between those who consider him to be far from being the best No. 10, and those who believe that Messi will be even better than Maradona.\nBorn in Rosario, he cut his teeth in the youth ranks of Newell's Old Boys, until a hormonal problem that affected his growth changed the plans of his family and, of course, his personal future. Facing expensive treatment for their son, Messi's parents moved to Spain as Newell's were not able to afford the medical costs related to his condition, and even the wealthiest Argentine teams, such as River Plate, refused to foot the bill.\nAfter his first trial with Barcelona, the Catalan coaches had no doubts. They decided to sign Messi and pay for his medical treatment. His growth was noticeable within Barca, and in little time he came to be considered one of the great talents at the club. He made his debut in the first division in October 2004, against Espanyol, and Barcelona have since adopted him as one of their greatest idols.\nHis first championship would come in the Liga season of 2004-05. Since then, and playing a more prominent role every season, he has won every major club trophy at Camp Nou -- including a stunning haul of six in 2008-09 -- and claimed the World Player of the Year [later the FIFA Ballon d'Or] award four times in four years.\nMessi has proven his credentials on the biggest stage with goals in two of the three Champions League finals he has won with Barcelona, with his achievements leaving many in little doubt that he is the best player of his generation; possibly of all time.\nThat idea was given further weight in March 2012 when, at the age of 24, he became the all-time top scorer at Barcelona -- beating the 232 goals of Cesar Rodriguez.\nThe forward's hat-trick in Barcelona's 4-3 win over Real Madrid in March 2014 also saw him become the all-time top scorer in El Clasico clashes.\nMessi endured criticism over his performances during the 2013-14 campaign despite scoring 28 goals in 31 Liga appearances as Barcelona lost the title to Atletico Madrid in a dramatic final day clash, but the forward committed his long-term future to the club with a new deal in May 2014 and came back with a bang to claim the Treble of La Liga, Champions League and Copa del Rey after scoring 43 goals in 38 games.\nAs the top scorer for Barcelona, and still under the age of 30, Messi is simply one of the best there has ever been.",imageURL:"http://s.weltsport.net/bilder/spieler/gross/26622.jpg",__v:0},{_id:"587194135b42b30011081c70",fullName:"Neymar da Silva Santos J\xfanior",popularName:"neymar",nationality:"Brazil",age:25,dateOfBirth:"05/02/1992",weight:68,height:175,shirtNumber:11,position:"Left Wing",rating:92,description:"Every so often a young Brazilian forward of such dazzling potential emerges that comparisons are immediately made with the greatest of all, Pele.\nAs another graduate of the Santos academy, and a player who has made a stunning impact in his teens, it is inevitable that Neymar has become one of them. However, he has said that his style is closer to that of Garrincha, and that Romario is his hero in the Selecao shirt. The early indications are that this hugely talented forward might just have the potential to join the ranks of Brazil greats.\nThough still in his formative years, Neymar has already dazzled in Brazilian domestic football and at youth level for his country, and now he is beginning to do the same for the senior side.\nSince being overlooked for the 2010 World Cup by Dunga, despite pleas from Pele himself, Neymar has become the central figure for Brazil, amassing a total of 65 caps for the senior side.\nA Santos player since 2003, he made his debut aged 17 and quickly shot to fame when winning the Campeonato Paulista in 2010 and being named the best player in the competition. Maintaining an impressive strike-rate, he shone alongside his stylistic soul-mate Robinho upon his loan return to the club from Manchester City, and was the subject of a 23-million-pound offer from Chelsea in August 2010, which he rejected to continue his career in Brazil.\nIt proved to be a wise choice as Neymar was on the scoresheet when Santos defeated Penarol in June 2011 to claim their first Copa Libertadores title since 1963. The fleet-footed forward was awarded the FIFA Puskas award for his sensational solo goal against Flamengo and followed in the footsteps of Diego Maradona, Zico and Pele by winning the 2011 South American Footballer of the Year.\nWith 100 goals already to his name by his 20th birthday, Neymar's next task was to transfer his club form to the international side though he failed to make an impact at the 2011 Copa America, where Brazil were defeated by Paraguay in the quarterfinals. However, he did score three goals in the London 2012 Olympics as Brazil lost out on the gold medal to Mexico in the final.\nYet, Neymar's coming of age finally arrived at the 2013 Confederations Cup when he opened the scoring with a tremendous half volley in the third minute of the opening match against Japan. This was to be Neymar's tournament as he scored four goals, including one in the 3-0 final victory over Spain.\nA big money move to Barcelona transpired that summer for Brazil's golden boy and he opened his account for the club in the first leg of Barcelona's Spanish Supercopa victory over Atletico Madrid. A further 14 goals followed as Barcelona missed out on the La Liga title on the final day -- though Neymar was largely absent for their run-in as a result of injury.\nAll eyes were on Neymar at the start of the 2014 World Cup, and he did not disappoint in scoring four goals for Brazil. However, his tournament was cut short when he suffered a fractured vertebra in his back during Brazil's 2-0 quarterfinal victory over Colombia. With Neymar injured, Brazil suffered their worst ever World Cup defeat, a 7-1 dismantling against Germany in the semifinals.\nA stronger and more determined Neymar returned from that back injury and helped lead Barcelona to a second Treble, including 22 goals during the 2014-15 La Liga campaign and the final strike for Barcelona in their 3-1 Champions League final triumph over Juventus.\nOnce again, all hopes for another international trophy for Brazil fell on Neymar's shoulders at the 2015 Copa America in Chile, yet Neymar failed to complete the event after being suspended for four matches due to comments made to the referee following Brazil's 1-0 group stage defeat to Colombia.",imageURL:"http://s.weltsport.net/bilder/spieler/gross/142105.jpg",__v:0},{_id:"5871a8ce6829ee00110f85e2",fullName:"Luis Su\xe1rez",popularName:"suarez",nationality:"Uruguay",age:30,dateOfBirth:"24/01/1987",weight:86,height:182,shirtNumber:9,position:"Striker",rating:91,description:"One of football's most divisive figures, Luis Suarez is a supremely gifted player who is tainted by an inability to stay out of trouble. His talent has never been in question but controversy never seems to be far from him, making it all the more surprising that Barcelona gambled \xa375 million on taking him to Catalonia from Liverpool in the summer of 2014.\nThe year of 2014 perfectly encapsulated Suarez, from the sublime to the ridiculous. He finished the 2013-14 season as the Premier League's top scorer, his irrepressible presence in the Liverpool forward line taking the club to within a whisker of winning a first league title in 24 years. Then came the World Cup, a bite on Italy's Giorgio Chiellini seen around the globe and a subsequent four-month ban from football. The flawed genius had struck again.\nParallels could certainly be drawn with 2010, the year that first launched Suarez into world superstardom, as well as global infamy. After finishing the 2009-10 season with a remarkable tally of 49 goals in 48 games in all competitions for Ajax, winning the Dutch Cup in the process, Suarez travelled to South Africa to contest the World Cup with Uruguay. In the quarterfinals against Ghana, he blocked a goal-bound effort in the final minute of extra time, earning a red card and conceding a penalty. However, Asamoah Gyan missed from 12 yards and Uruguay prevailed in the subsequent shootout, leading Suarez to be castigated by many for his role in the elimination of Africa's final competitors.\nHis magnetic attraction to negative PR was displayed once again in November 2010 when he was banned for seven games for biting PSV Eindhoven midfielder Otman Bakkal. The incident marked the final match of a wildly successful career in the Eredivisie following his move from Nacional in 2006, when he left the Uruguayan club having won the league in his debut season in the first team.\nIt was Groningen who brought him to the Netherlands for around 800,000 euros and, after scoring 10 goals in 29 games in his first season in the country, Ajax paid \u20ac7.5 million to take him to Amsterdam. Prior to the start of the 2010-11 season, he had repaid them handsomely with 74 goals in 97 league appearances, leading to speculation of a move to one of Europe's bigger clubs, and specifically Liverpool -- a club he eventually agreed to join for \xa322.8 million in the 2011 January transfer window.\nSuarez made an immediate impact at Liverpool, scoring on his Premier League debut against Stoke and endearing himself to the Anfield faithful thanks to his energy on the pitch. Hopes were high for his first full season after he was named the 2011 Copa America's Best Player as Uruguay won the tournament but, despite netting a respectable 17 goals in all competitions, his scoring form was marked by a propensity to hit the post rather than the back of the net in 2011-12. A superb hat trick against Norwich was perhaps his most positive contribution, while his most negative was unquestionably the eight-match ban he received for using racist language towards Manchester United's Patrice Evra. The suspension served to increase speculation about the striker's future, but he signed a new contract with the Reds in August 2012 shortly after appearing for Uruguay at the London Olympics.\nThe 2012-13 season saw Suarez significantly step up his game as he scored 23 goals in 33 games -- including another treble against Norwich -- as new Reds boss Brendan Rodgers brought the best out of him on the pitch. A particularly promising partnership was struck up with Daniel Sturridge following his arrival in January 2013, but Suarez would produce another blot on his copybook before the season was through. During a match against Chelsea in April, Suarez -- for the second time in his career -- sunk his teeth into an opponent. This time, Branislav Ivanovic was the victim and Suarez was banned for eight matches.\nA summer of speculation followed, with Suarez suggesting he was ready to leave Anfield and Arsenal testing Liverpool's resolve, before the Uruguayan agreed to stay. It was to the benefit of both player and club. Banned for the first five games of the season, Suarez played in every remaining Premier League match after his return, scoring 31 goals in 33 goals as Liverpool -- unfancied before the start of the season -- came agonisingly close to winning the title. Of course, there was a third hat trick in three seasons against Norwich.\nHe went into the World Cup nursing a knee injury but was still expected to be one of the stars of the tournament. After a Suarez-less Uruguay lost to Costa Rica in their opening game, the talisman returned to face -- of all teams -- England. A match-winning brace against the Three Lions demonstrated again just how devastating a footballer he could be and all the talk was of a man who had achieved redemption.\nThat talk soon stopped.\nIn the final group game against Italy, Suarez became tangled with Chiellini. The teeth marks on the Azzurri defender's shoulder, along with the numerous television replays, showed that -- remarkably -- Suarez had bitten an opponent for the third time in his career. Despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary, Suarez and Uruguay -- players, fans, even the president -- denied that a bite had taken place. Eventually, Suarez admitted his crime but not before FIFA threw the book at him, banning him from all football-related activity to four months.\nLiverpool had already backed Suarez through two high-profile controversies, but the Chiellini incident was one misdemeanour too many and the Reds opted to cash-in on their star player. Barcelona came calling and Suarez moved to the city in which his in-laws reside, beginning his search for redemption all over again.\nAfter serving his club suspension, Suarez made his La Liga debut for Barcelona in the Clasico versus Real Madrid on Oct. 25, a match that ended 3-1 to Real. After a hesitant start at the Camp Nou, Suarez took flight and helped the Catalonians win their second Treble by tallying 16 goals in La Liga and scoring the winner in the Champions League final against Juventus.",imageURL:"http://s.weltsport.net/bilder/spieler/gross/43635.jpg",__v:0},{_id:"5871a8ce6829ee00110f85e3",fullName:"Andr\xe9s Iniesta Lugan",popularName:"iniesta",nationality:"Spain",age:32,dateOfBirth:"11/05/1984",weight:68,height:171,shirtNumber:6,position:"Left Center Midfield",rating:89,description:"Andr\xe9s Iniesta Luj\xe1n is a Spanish professional footballer who plays as a central midfielder for FC Barcelona and the Spain national team.
